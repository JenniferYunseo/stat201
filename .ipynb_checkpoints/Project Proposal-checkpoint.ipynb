    "## Introduction\n",

    "Begin by providing some relevant background information on the topic so that someone unfamiliar with it will be prepared to understand the rest of your proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly state the question you will try to answer with your project. Your question should involve one or more random variables of interest, spread across two or more categories that are interesting to compare. For example, you could consider the annual maxima river flow at two different locations along a river, or perhaps gender diversity at different universities. Of the response variable, identify one location parameter (mean, median, quantile, etc.) and one scale parameter (standard deviation, inter-quartile range, etc.) that would be useful in answering your question. Justify your choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE (Mar 1, 2022): If it doesn’t make sense to infer a scale parameter, you can choose another parameter, or choose a second variable altogether. Ultimately, we’re looking for a comprehensive inference analysis on one parameter spread across 2+ groups (with at least one hypothesis test), plus a bit more (such as an investigation on the variance, a quantile, or a different variable). In total, you should use both bootstrapping and asymptotics somewhere in your report at least once each. Also, your hypothesis test(s) need not be significant: it is perfectly fine to write a report claiming no significant findings (i.e. your p-value is large).\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify and describe the dataset that will be used to answer the question. Remember, this dataset is allowed to contain more variables than you need – feel free to drop them!\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, be sure to frame your question/objectives in terms of what is already known in the literature. Be sure to include at least two scientific publications that can help frame your study (you will need to include these in the References section). We have no specific citation style requirements, but be consistent.\n"

    "The gender pay gap is the difference between wages earned by men and women. The disparity has long been reported (Maloney 2016). The Equal Pay Act was signed by President John F.Kennedy in 1963 (cite) and it mandates that women should receive equal pay for doing \"substantially equal\" work. Over the last 50 years, numerous laws and legislation have been passed in hope to deminish the disparity. However, Statistic Canada reported that female employees in Ontario earned $0.75 for every dollars earned by men in 2020(Statistics Canada data from the Canadian Income Survey). In this report, we would confirm whether women are earning less than men. We will compare mean of income and standard deviation between men and women. To achieve this, we used a dataset genereated by scraping of Glassdoor. It contains income for various job titles based on gender. \n",
